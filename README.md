# ReadAll

This is the initial Android application project. It uses Gradle as the build system and Kotlin for the main source code.

## Building

Make sure you have the Android SDK installed and `ANDROID_HOME` set.

To build the project, run:

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

The Gradle wrapper JAR will be downloaded automatically on the first run.
The APK can then be found in `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`.
